Project Overview

AI-Powered Study Companion is a web application designed to help students and learners quickly summarize notes, extract key points, and create flashcards. By leveraging AI, users can upload or paste their study material and instantly get concise, organized content, saving time and improving learning efficiency.

This project demonstrates the use of React for frontend, Node.js for backend, and OpenAI API for AI-powered text processing.

Features

Upload or Paste Notes: Easily input your study material in text format.

AI Summarization: Generate concise summaries of long notes.

Key Points Extraction: Highlight important concepts for quick revision.

Flashcard Creation: Convert notes into flashcards for effective memorization.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for seamless experience.

Technologies Used

Frontend: React

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database (optional): MongoDB (if storing user history)

AI Service: OpenAI API for text summarization and analysis

Hosting: Bolt

How It Works

User opens the web app and inputs notes by uploading a file or pasting text.

The input is sent to the backend (Node.js server).

Backend calls the OpenAI API to process the notes.

AI generates summaries, key points, or flashcards.

Results are sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.
