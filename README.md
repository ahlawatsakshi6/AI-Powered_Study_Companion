## **How It Works**
1. User opens the web app and inputs notes by uploading a file or pasting text.  
2. The input is sent to the backend (Node.js server).  
3. Backend calls the OpenAI API to process the notes.  
4. AI generates summaries, key points, or flashcards.  
5. Results are sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.
